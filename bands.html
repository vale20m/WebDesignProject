                <p>It was extremely difficult to narrow down the best rock bands of all time, thanks to the volume of artists and the smorgasbord of sub-genres (alternative, rock, psychedelic, punk, new wave, grunge, metal, just to name a few—and all of the sub-sub-genres within those). Because of this, there are going to be bands here not everyone agrees with, and there may be bands missing that may shock some. That's OK! At its core, rock 'n' roll is about rebellion, going against the grain and doing your own thing—and doing it loudly and with abandon.</p>
